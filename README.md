# Kotlin Detail Navigation App

This project is an Android app developed as part of the Android module at the Syntax Institute. It is written in **Kotlin** using **Android Studio** and focuses on key navigation concepts such as **Navigation Components**, **Bottom Navigation**, **Fragments**, **Activities**, and **Intents**. The app demonstrates how to build a multi-screen Android application with seamless navigation and a user-friendly interface.

## About the App

The Kotlin Detail Navigation App showcases how to implement navigation in an Android app using modern practices. It includes features like **Bottom Navigation** for switching between main sections, **Fragments** for modular UI components, and **Intents** for navigating between activities. The app also uses the **Navigation Component** to simplify navigation logic and manage back stack behavior.

## Features

- **Bottom Navigation**: Switch between different sections of the app using a bottom navigation bar.
- **Fragments**: Use fragments to create modular and reusable UI components.
- **Navigation Component**: Implement navigation between fragments and activities using the Navigation Component.
- **Intents**: Navigate between activities and pass data using intents.
- **Activities**: Manage different screens and their lifecycles.

## Technologies and Concepts

- **Kotlin**: The programming language used for Android development.
- **Bottom Navigation**: A user-friendly way to switch between app sections.
- **Fragments**: Modular UI components that can be reused across the app.
- **Navigation Component**: Simplify navigation logic and manage back stack behavior.
- **Intents**: Navigate between activities and pass data.
- **Activities**: Represent individual screens and manage their lifecycles.
- **Android Studio**: The official IDE for Android development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LarsNicodemus/kotlin-detail-navigation-app.git
Open the project in Android Studio.

Build and run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.

### Usage
Use the Bottom Navigation Bar to switch between different sections of the app.

Navigate between Fragments using the Navigation Component.

Use Intents to navigate to a new activity and pass data between screens.

Observe how Activities and Fragments manage their lifecycles during navigation.
